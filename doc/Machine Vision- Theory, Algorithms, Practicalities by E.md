# Livros e teoria

**Machine Vision: Theory, Algorithms, Practicalities** by E. R. Davies In the 3rd edition, see section 6.3, "Object Labeling and Counting"

**Handbook of Image and Video Processing**  by Gonzalez and Woods See section 9.5.3 "Extraction of Connected Components" The presentation is less clear, but this is a standard all-in-one textbook for image processing. The section on thresholding for binarization is good. An international edition costs about $35.

Older textbooks may have simple, straightforward descriptions. Used copies of
**Computer Vision** by Ballard and Brown are quite cheap. In that book, Algorithm 5.1 is called Blob Coloring.

My favorite quick description can be found in the section "Region Labeling Algorithm" of **Handbook of Image and Video Processing** edited by Al Bovik. Conveniently, pages 44 - 45 are available online in Google Books: http://books.google.com/books?id=UM_GCfJe88sC&q=region+labeling+algorithm#v=snippet&q=region%20labeling%20algorithm&f=false
